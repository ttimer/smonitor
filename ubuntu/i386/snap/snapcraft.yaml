name: smonitor
version: "0.0.1beta-xxxx"
summary: Monitoring of server states (and other things)
description: SMonitor beta version (as is) -- Prerequisite: Java 8 or higher! --- Built on/for Linux KUbuntu 16.04, Java 8, i386, Apache2 web server and MySQL data base server (status quo 06/2018) -- it might run on other system configurations as well, but the parameters of this little utility are not changeable yet. ---- With different init methods (SysV/Upstart/systemd) and after some updates the servers were startet at boot time even if they should not, so I put this tool into 'Autostart' to be informed of the misbehavior.
grade: stable         # must be 'stable' to release into candidate/stable channels
